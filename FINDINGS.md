* I got to know that with `agno` framework, it's possible to stream internal events that agent is going through, like tool call, reasoing, memory updates, etc.

* It'll be interesting for consumers of your solution, to get glimpse of what agent is doing internally before providing you with final response.
  * Though, you have to be careful of what you're showing to your consumers.
  * For e.g., your business might not like to show which tool is being called.
  
* Check [this](https://docs.agno.com/basics/agents/running-agents#streaming-internal-events) part of doc:
